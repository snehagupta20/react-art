# React Art: CSS Styling in React

## Overview

In React development, styling can be approached in several ways. This document explores various methods, including Vanilla CSS, Inline Styles, and CSS Modules, and provides a comparative analysis of their pros and cons.

## Vanilla CSS

### Advantages

1. **Decoupled from JSX**: CSS code is separated from JSX code, making it easier to manage styles independently.
2. **Familiar Syntax**: You can write CSS code in the way you are accustomed to.
3. **Separate Development**: CSS can be written by a different developer who needs minimal access to JSX code.

### Disadvantages

1. **CSS Knowledge Required**: A good understanding of CSS is necessary.
2. **Lack of Scoping**: CSS rules are not scoped to components, which can lead to conflicts. For example, the same CSS class name might be used in different components for different purposes.

### Solutions for Scoping

#### Solution 1: Inline Styles

**Advantages**

1. **Quick and Easy**: Simple to add directly to JSX.
2. **Scoped Styling**: Styles only affect the element to which they are applied.
3. **Dynamic Styling**: Conditional styling is straightforward to implement.

**Disadvantages**

1. **CSS Knowledge Required**: Understanding of CSS is still needed.
2. **Individual Styling**: Each element must be styled individually, which can be cumbersome.
3. **Messy Code**: No separation between CSS and JSX code, leading to cluttered components.

#### Solution 2: CSS Modules

CSS Modules offer a way to scope CSS by transforming class names to ensure uniqueness per file. This requires configuration of your build tool.

**Usage**

Rename `header.css` to `header.module.css`, and import it as follows:

```jsx
import classes from './header.module.css';

<p className={classes.paragraph}></p>
```

**Example CSS (header.module.css)**

```css
.paragraph {
    color: red;
}
```

The class name will be transformed into a unique name, e.g., `paragraph -> _paragraph_ajsi123`, to avoid conflicts.

**Disadvantages**

1. **Multiple CSS Files**: May result in many small CSS files throughout the project.

## Styled Components

Styled Components is a library for styling React components using tagged template literals. To use Styled Components, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Package**

    ```bash
    npm install styled-components
    ```

    After installation, restart the development server.

2. **Import `styled`**

    ```jsx
    import { styled } from 'styled-components';
    ```

    `styled` is a JavaScript object that provides access to different properties using dot notation.

3. **Create Styled Components**

    Example of creating a styled `div`:

    ```jsx
    const ControlContainer = styled.div`
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      gap: 0.5rem;
      margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
    `;
    ```

    **Before:**

    ```html
    <div class="control">...</div>
    <!-- This div has a classname 'control' for styling -->
    ```

    **After:**

    ```html
    <ControlContainer></ControlContainer>
    <!-- This div will have the styles applied as defined above -->
    ```

4. **Dynamic Styling**

    Example of adding dynamic styles:

    ```jsx
    const Label = styled.label`
      color: ${(props) => props.invalid ? '#f87171' : '#6b7280'};
    `;
    ```

5. **Nested Styling**

    You can style nested elements by using the `&` selector:

    ```jsx
    const StyledHeader = styled.header`
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      margin-top: 2rem;
      margin-bottom: 2rem;

      & img {
        object-fit: contain;
        margin-bottom: 2rem;
        width: 11rem;
        height: 11rem;
      }

      & h1 {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
        font-weight: 600;
        letter-spacing: 0.4em;
        text-align: center;
        text-transform: uppercase;
        color: #9a3412;
        font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;
        margin: 0;
      }

      & p {
        text-align: center;
        color: #a39191;
        margin: 0;
      }

      @media (min-width: 768px) {
        & {
          margin-bottom: 4rem;
        }

        & h1 {
          font-size: 2.25rem;
        }
      }
    `;
    ```

## Tailwind CSS

### Pros

1. **No Need for CSS Knowledge**: Tailwind CSS abstracts away the complexity of writing custom CSS.
2. **Rapid Development**: Provides utility classes for quick styling.
3. **Avoids Styling Clashes**: Utility classes help prevent style conflicts.
4. **Highly Configurable & Extensible**: Easily customizable to fit your needs.

### Cons

1. **Many CSS Classes**: Can lead to a large number of utility classes in your JSX.
2. **More Code in JSX**: Increases the amount of code within your JSX files.
